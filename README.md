# WeatherApp 

**WeatherApp** is a simple Java console application that consumes the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) to fetch real-time weather data for any given location using latitude and longitude.  
It demonstrates how to make HTTP GET requests in Java, parse JSON responses, and display the data in a structured format.

## Features
- Fetches real-time weather data without requiring an API key.
- Displays temperature, wind speed, weather code, and timestamp.
- Uses Java's `HttpURLConnection` for HTTP requests.
- Parses JSON data using the `org.json` library.
- Built with Maven for easy dependency management.

## Technologies Used
- Java 8+
- Maven
- org.json (JSON parsing)
- Open-Meteo Public REST API
